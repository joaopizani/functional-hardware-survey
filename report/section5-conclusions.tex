\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}
    TODO: Reiterate the analysis of the EDSLs spread throughout the analysis of each of the studied
    circuits, but in a more summarized manner, actually \textbf{comparing} the EDSLs among
    themselves, \textbf{by aspect} (the ones we defined in section \ref{subsec:aspects}).
