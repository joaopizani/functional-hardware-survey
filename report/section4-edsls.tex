    \subsection{Lava}
    \label{subsec:lava}

        Lava\cite{lava1998} is an EDSL for hardware description developed originally around 1998 at
        Chalmers University of Technology, in Sweden. It uses Haskell as the host language, and
        circuits described in Lava are \emph{deeply embedded}.

        The Lava EDSL has several ``dialects'', among which are Xilinx-Lava, York-Lava, Kansas-Lava
        and Chalmers-Lava. Xilinx-Lava\cite{xilinx-lava} was developed by Satnam Singh and puts a
        greater emphasis on the \emph{layout} of the described circuits, focusing on their
        implementation in Xilinx's FPGAs. York-Lava was developed as part of the
        Reduceron\cite{reduceron} project, and is a variation of Chalmers-Lava, omitting some
        features and adding some others, like a ``Prelude'' of commonly used circuits
        ((de)multiplexers, (de)coders, RAM memory blocks, etc.). Chalmers-Lava is considered the
        ``standard'' dialect, also being the one which was first developed, therefore it was chosen
        as the one to be studied in this project.

        Before diving into the inner workings of the Chalmers Lava library, we first need to make
        clear that there are two very distinct versions of this library. The original paper that
        defines the Lava language\cite{lava1998} contains the first version, while the current
        version is the one defined in a later thesis\cite{claessen-thesis} by Koen Claessen
        This current version of Chalmers Lava is the one in which our case study is based.

        As already said, Lava uses a \emph{deep embedding}, and the datatype used to represent a
        circuit is \texttt{Signal}, defined in listing~\ref{lst:lava-signal}.

        \begin{listing}[h!]
            \haskellfile{code/lava/lava-signal.hs}
            \caption{Lava's \texttt{Signal} datatype, used to represent circuits.
                \label{lst:lava-signal}}
        \end{listing}

        As can be noticed from the definition, the \emph{actual} circuit type (\texttt{S}) is
        ``wrapped'' around the \texttt{Ref} type constructor. This has to do with the approach that
        Lava takes to solving the problem of observable sharing, which is to rely on comparing
        \emph{references to object} given by the Haskell implementation, to detect cycles in syntax
        graphs representing circuits. This approach is the cause of some of Lava's advantages as
        well as disadvantages, which will be discussed further ahead.

        Having defined a circuit operating on values of a type \texttt{a} to have type
        \texttt{Signal a}, then there are several circuit combinators provided by Lava, which take
        circuits as inputs and provide circuits as outputs. For example, on listing
        \ref{lst:lava-boolean-combinators} we show some boolean circuit combinators:

        \begin{listing}[h!]
            \haskellfile{code/lava/lava-boolean-combinators.hs}
            \caption{Some of Lava's boolean circuit combinators.
                \label{lst:lava-boolean-combinators}}
        \end{listing}

        With Lava, one can also model circuits operating on \texttt{Int}s (and there are several
        interesting integer circuit combinators already included in the Lava library). However, our
        goal in this project was to model \emph{boolean} circuits and, besides that, integer
        circuits offer a reduced set of features.


        \subsubsection{Circuits modeled}
        \label{subsubsec:lava-circuits}

            In order to be able to describe circuit 1, the ALU (described in more detail on section
            \ref{subsec:circuit-alu}), we first needed to model the necessary parts. The ``core'' of
            the ALU is composed of a 16-bit ripple-carry adder and a 16-bit \texttt{AND} gate. To
            model the ripple-carry adder we used full adders as parts, which in turn used half
            adders. To get used to the way in which circuits are described in Lava, let us first
            take a look at the definition of the hierarchy of adders in listing
            \ref{lst:lava-circuit1-model-adders}:

            \begin{listing}[h!]
                \haskellfile{code/lava/lava-circuit1-model-adders.hs}
                \caption{Hierarchy of adders used in circuit 1.
                    \label{lst:lava-circuit1-model-adders}}
            \end{listing}

            Based on this small model we can already make some observations concerning the aspects
            that we are analyzing. These observations are:

            \begin{itemize}
                \item All circuits in Lava must be modeled as \emph{uncurried} functions, that is,
                    if multiple inputs are needed, they need to be packed into one tuple, the same
                    ``packing'' happens also in the case of multiple outputs.

                \item The \emph{basic} type of input/output for all circuits modeled is
                    \texttt{Signal Bool}. This is not coincidental: Lava's VHDL generation backend
                    can only work with circuits whose input/output types are \texttt{Signal Bool} or
                    any nested combination of tuples and lists thereof.  This limitation makes Lava
                    have low \textbf{extensibility}, not allowing -- for example -- user-defined
                    types.

                \item In Lava, (families of) circuits with variable-sized inputs/outputs are modeled
                    as lists (as can be seen in the definition of \texttt{rippleCarryAdder}). This
                    approach has a good \textbf{genericity}, but is \textbf{not type-safe enough}.
                    For example, we could have a circuit assuming that its inputs are 32-bit wide.
                    There is no way to enforce, at \emph{Haskell compilation time}, that inputs with
                    correct size are provided.  Possible problems could only be detected at
                    simulation or VHDL generation.
            \end{itemize}

            Now, after having defined all the necessary parts, lets take a look at the ALU circuit
            itself in listing~\ref{lst:lava-circuit1-model-alu}:

            \begin{listing}[h!]
                \haskellfile{code/lava/lava-circuit1-model-alu.hs}
                \caption{Top-level model for circuit 1, the ALU.
                    \label{lst:lava-circuit1-model-alu}}
            \end{listing}

            In the definition of the ALU itself, we would like to have a user-defined datatype to
            represent the kinds of functions that can be computed by the ALU, i.e, the functions
            listed on table \ref{tab:alu-functions}. However, due to the limitations of the VHDL
            backend already discussed, we have to define \texttt{ALUControlBits} as simply a
            \emph{type synonym} for a 6-tuple of bits.

            Besides modeling the three circuits in Lava, we also simulated them. The definition of
            the ALU circuit in the book "The Elements of Computing Systems"\cite{nand2tetris-book}
            has a pretty extensive truth table to test the circuit model, which was used to simulate
            the ALU. However, let's take a look at a simpler simulation case, that of a half-adder,
            in listing~\ref{lst:lava-circuit1-simulation-hadd}:

            \begin{listing}[h!]
                \haskellfile{code/lava/lava-circuit1-simulation-hadd.hs}
                \caption{Simulation of a half adder in Lava.
                    \label{lst:lava-circuit1-simulation-hadd}}
            \end{listing}

            Simulation of combinational circuits is performed by the Lava function
            \texttt{simulate}; it takes as arguments the circuit to simulate and an input
            combination. In the example of simulation for the \texttt{halfAdder}, we \emph{map} the
            simulation over a list of input combinations, covering all possible cases.

            The attentive reader might be asking why is this simulation not an automated test, i.e,
            why are we \textbf{not} comparing the results of the simulation with an \emph{expected}
            output sequence. This has to do with the way in which Lava handles the problem of
            observable sharing: values of type \texttt{Signal a} encapsulate effectively a
            \emph{runtime reference} to an object of type \texttt{a}. Therefore, even though
            \emph{actual} and \emph{expected} outputs might appear to be equal, they are considered
            different by Lava. Here is the offending \texttt{Eq} instance from the Lava library
            (module \texttt{Lava.Signal}):

            \begin{haskellcode}
        instance Eq (Signal a) where
            Signal (Symbol r1) == Signal (Symbol r2) = r1 == r2
            \end{haskellcode}

            This \texttt{Eq} instance implements a sort of \emph{reference equality}, instead of the
            more usual \emph{value equality}. This behaviour is, however, desirable when we consider
            how Lava represents circuits: a more traditional (recursive) definition of equality
            could result in non-termination when comparing circuits with loops.

            Even with the drawback of not having \emph{automated} testing, we can say that Lava does
            provide good \textbf{simulation} capabilities, with an interface that is easy to
            understand for functional programmers.

            Now, before moving on to the next circuit studied, let's take a look at how Lava handles
            \emph{formal verification} with two examples: checking that a full adder is commutative
            and that the output of an incrementer circuit is always different from its input:

            \haskellfile{code/lava/lava-circuit1-verify-fulladder.hs}

            A property over a circuit in Lava is modeled as a circuit containing \emph{one boolean
                output}, which -- for the property to be true -- needs to be \emph{true} for any
            combination of inputs (these properties are called \emph{safety properties}). Lava
            performs the verification by converting the circuit model to a CNF logical formula and
            executing an external SAT solver on the negation of the formula: the property is
            \emph{valid} if and only if the negated formula is unsatisfiable. The verification for
            the incrementer introduces another detail of this kind of verification:

            \haskellfile{code/lava/lava-circuit1-verify-incrementer.hs}

            We can see by the type of the verification function that it is a \emph{property
                generator}, i.e, for each integer \texttt{n}, it gives a property. An incrementer is
            a circuit with generic input/output size, but the SAT-solving approach to verification
            can only prove properties for \emph{circuits of fixed size}. Therefore, we can only
            verify a finite number of particular instances of the circuit.

            Moving on to circuit 2 (the RAM block), we will take a look at how Lava handles
            sequential circuits. The ``fundamental''\footnote{\emph{fundamental} means that all
                sequential circuits use -- directly or indirectly -- \texttt{delay} as a building
                block} sequential circuit in Lava is \texttt{delay}.  It takes two boolean signals
            as input and outputs a single boolean signal. Its semantics is that the output signal
            will correspond tho the input signal \emph{delayed} by one clock cycle, with the other
            parameter being the first value of the output.  Using this fundamental circuit, we
            modeled the first building block of our hierarchy of memory elements: a 1-bit register
            with input and load signals:

            \haskellfile{code/lava/lava-circuit2-model-reg.hs}

            In this model, we use a \texttt{mux} to control whether the next state of the output
            will be simply the previous state, or the input value will be ``loaded'' into the
            register. Now, a 1-bit register can easily be ``lifted'' into a generic n-bit circuit:

            \haskellfile{code/lava/lava-circuit2-model-regN.hs}

            The \texttt{regN} definition is \emph{generic}, and parameterized by the size of the
            input and output (\texttt{n}). This means that \emph{for each value of n, there is a
                circuit \texttt{regN n}}. In Lava, however, we can only simulate and generate VHDL
            for specific instances of this family of circuits. The restriction with regards to VHDL
            generation is not a theoretical limitation, that because VHDL has good support for
            \emph{generic components}, and one could imagine Lava generating generic VHDL from
            generic circuit models. But, leaving that discussion aside, let's take a look at the
            simulation case for \texttt{regN}:

            \haskellfile{code/lava/lava-circuit2-simulation-regN.hs}

            The \texttt{simulateSeq} function is intended for the simulation of sequential circuits:
            the list of inputs its given is the sequence of values present at the input ports of the
            circuit under test -- one element of the list for each clock cycle. The list of outputs
            given by \texttt{simulateSeq} has a similar interpretation.

            Having the core sequential component for our memory bank (\texttt{regN}), we modeled
            some other helper components (such as an \emph{address decoder} and a 64-to-1
            \emph{multiplexer}). With all the components at our disposal, we then modeled the RAM
            block itself:

            \haskellfile{code/lava/lava-circuit2-model-ram64.hs}

            All the registers in the memory bank are connected to the ``global'' input word for the
            bank, but the load signal for any particular register is active \emph{iff} the global
            \texttt{load} signal is active \emph{and} (\texttt{<\&>}) that particular memory line is
            selected. Finally, to be precise, \texttt{ram64Rows} actually defines a family of
            circuits, one for each value of \texttt{n}. The one we are interested in is
            \texttt{ram64Rows 16}, for a RAM block with 64 lines, in which each line is 16 bits
            wide.

            Finally, the last circuit we studied under Lava (circuit 3) is the Hack CPU (described
            in more detail on section \ref{subsec:hack-cpu-circuit}). The CPU circuit is mostly
            combinational, as it contains \emph{no form of pipelining} and exactly one instruction
            is executed per clock cycle. However, there is one sequential component of the CPU: the
            \emph{program counter}, shown in listing~\ref{lst:lava-circuit3-model-pc}:

            \begin{listing}[h!]
                \haskellfile{code/lava/lava-circuit3-model-pc.hs}
                \caption{Lava model for the program counter inside the Hack CPU.
                    \label{lst:lava-circuit3-model-pc}}
            \end{listing}

            The program counter counts cyclically between $ 0 $ and $ 2^{n-1} $, and can have its
            value reset or set to a particular value at any moment. Having defined the program
            counter, there are still some helper parts to define before writing the model for the
            CPU itself: most importantly, we need an \emph{instruction decoder}, responsible for
            interpreting each \texttt{Hack} instruction and outputting several \emph{control bits}
            that are used to direct the data flow inside the CPU during each instruction execution
            cycle. The Lava code for the decoder can be seen on listing
            \ref{lst:lava-circuit3-model-decoder}.

            \begin{listing}[h!]
                \haskellfile{code/lava/lava-circuit3-model-instruction-decoder.hs}
                \caption{The instruction decoder of the Hack CPU.
                    \label{lst:lava-circuit3-model-decoder}}
            \end{listing}

            Here we notice again some limitations of Lava with regards to datatypes: we are limited
            to lists and tuples of \texttt{Signal Bool} (to keep the circuit synthesizable). We
            decided to model the \emph{Hack} instruction itself and the control flags as tuples, to
            prevent size-related runtime errors. However, using tuples made the model more
            ``cluttered'', as tuples are \emph{not} particularly prone to \emph{slicing} and
            \emph{regrouping} operations.

            The values \texttt{aFlag}, \texttt{cAM}, \texttt{cDest}, etc., in the definition of
            \texttt{instructionDecoder} are all contiguous regions of the input binary word,
            therefore the purpose of the \texttt{intructionDecoder} block is just to ``split'' the
            input word into some subregions with a defined meaning. However, the way in which the
            block is modelled (by pattern matching and then selecting bits \emph{individually} for
            the output tuples) does not clearly transmit the intention of the designer to someone
            reading the model.

            Using \emph{fixed-length vectors}, perhaps based on the recent ``Type-level Naturals''
            GHC \footnote{The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System:
                \url{http://www.haskell.org/ghc}} extension \cite{website:ghc-typenats} (introduced
            in GHC 7.6 and being improved for GHC 7.8) would make modeling in Lava \emph{safer} and
            more comfortable. We could simply say that \texttt{cJump} is the ``slice'' located
            between bits 13 and 15 of the input word, and so forth.


    \subsection{ForSyDe}
    \label{subsec:forsyde}
        The Haskell ForSyDe library is an implementation of the ``Formal System Design'' approach to
        hardware modeling\cite{forsyde1999}. The ForSyDe approach per se has several significant
        differences when compared to Lava, and even when the two EDSLs agree on \emph{what to do},
        sometimes they differ on how to achieve those goals.

        To better understand what characterizes the ForSyDe methodology, we first have to establish
        some vocabulary:

        \begin{description}
            \item[System] In ForSyDe, a system or circuit is a set of processes interconnected by
                \emph{signals}.

            \item[Signal] A signal is, intuitively, a stream of information that flows between
                processes. It carries events of some type, and each event has an associated
                \emph{tag}. The meaning of the tag is defined by the \emph{model of computation}
                used.

            \item[Process] A process is nothing more than a pure function on signals. A process
                \emph{is able} to hold internal state. But, given the same input (possibly infinite)
                signals, it produces the same output signals.

            \item[Process constructor] Every circuit in ForSyDe (even simplest combinational ones) is
                built using a \emph{process constructor}. A process constructor can be seen as a
                skeleton of behaviour, and it clearly separates computation from synchronization
                aspects. A process constructor takes a combinational function (called \emph{process
                    function}) as parameter -- expressing the computation aspect of the process, and
                possibly some extra values. There are combinational and sequential process
                constructors, and some representative examples from each class will be described in
                more detail in a specific subsection (\ref{subsubsec:forsyde-synchprocs}).
        \end{description}

        \subsubsection{Models of Computation}
        \label{subsubsec:forsyde-mocs}
            \acrodef{MoC}{Model of Computation}
            The definition of signal given above is purposefully ``vague'' mainly because the
            precise definition of meaning for signals depends on the \ac{MoC} being used.
            ForSyDe has (currently) process constructors for the following \acp{MoC}:

            \begin{description}
                \item[Synchronous] All processes in this \ac{MoC} have a global, implicit
                    \texttt{clock} input, and the tags in the signals are increasing natural
                    numbers. Therefore, a signal can be viewed as a \emph{stream} of values, one for
                    each clock cycle. At each clock cycle, \emph{all} processes consume exactly one
                    value from each of its inputs and produce one value at each of its outputs.

                \item[Untimed] In the untimed \ac{MoC}, the processes fire individually and there is
                    no notion of global clock. A process only evaluates when its inputs have a
                    minimum number of values \emph{ready} to be read. The number of needed values
                    can vary per input, but is constant throughout execution.

                \item[Continuous] The Continuous \ac{MoC} interprets signals as continuous,
                    one-variable piecewise functions of time. It can be used to model some forms of
                    analog circuits, for example.
            \end{description}

            \label{ref:forsyde-moc-synch}
            Among all \acp{MoC}, perhaps the most ``notable'' one is the Synchronous \ac{MoC},
            because it reflects the usual interpretation of signals as wires and the vast majority
            of digital designs nowadays having a global clock. Also, all of our studied circuits
            were modeled in ForSyDe using the Synchronous \ac{MoC}. Therefore, it is interesting to
            take a deeper look at it.

            First, lets take a look at the behaviour of a system which has an one integer input port
            and one integer output, and in which the value of the output is equal to the input plus
            4. The interface and internal architecture of this system (\emph{addFour}) is depicted
            in listing~\ref{lst:forsyde-addFour}.

            \begin{figure}[h!]
                \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{imgs/forsyde-addFour.pdf}
                \caption{The addFour circuit, example of usage of the Synchronous \ac{MoC}
                    \label{lst:forsyde-addFour}}
            \end{figure}

            Please bear in mind that this implementation is not by far an efficient method of adding
            4 to an integer. We use this architecture only as a simple example in which several
            characteristics of the synchronous \ac{MoC} can be spotted.

            The \texttt{addFour} system is built with 4 constituent processes, and each of them is
            built using the \texttt{mapSY} process constructor, a constructor of the synchronous
            \ac{MoC} (its name ends in ``SY''). It takes a combinational function (in this case
            ``+1'') and evaluates it for each event in the input signal, generating a corresponding
            event in the output signal.

            Another characteristic of ForSyDe which makes the synchronous \ac{MoC} even more
            significant is that only systems built \textbf{exclusively} with process constructors of
            the synchronous model can be translated into VHDL by ForSyDe.

            ForSyDe is a \emph{deeply embedded} EDSL, but it takes a significantly different
            approach than the one taken by Lava: instead of having some set of ``atomic'' circuits
            (they correspond to the constructors of the \texttt{S} type in Lava), ForSyDe uses
            Template Haskell to \emph{reify} Haskell source code into a syntax tree, and use this
            syntax tree in order to simulate and/or translate the circuit model into VHDL.

            On section \ref{subsubsec:forsyde-synchprocs} We take a closer look at synchronous
            process constructors, as well as the mechanism by which ForSyDe translates (small
            fragments of) Haskell source code into the ``building blocks'' of synchronous systems in
            VHDL.

            On section \ref{subsubsec:forsyde-circuits} we proceed to expose the circuits we modeled
            in ForSyDe, using the models to make a comparative analysis of ForSyDe with the other
            EDSLs.

        \subsubsection{Synchronous Process Constructors}
        \label{subsubsec:forsyde-synchprocs}
            In the ForSyDe Haskell package, the module \texttt{ForSyDe.Process.SynchProc} provides
            the list of process constructors that a can be used to build systems in ForSyDe's
            Synchronous Model of Computation (\ref{ref:forsyde-moc-synch}). The functions provided
            in that module can be divided in 2 big groups:

            \begin{description}

                \item[Combinational] Combinations process constructors build processes in which the
                    value on a certain output at time $t$ depends \emph{only} on the input values at
                    time $t$. A simple example of a combinational process constructor is:

                    \begin{haskellcode}
        mapSY :: (ProcType a, ProcType b) => ProcId
              -> ProcFun (a -> b) -> Signal a -> Signal b
                    \end{haskellcode}

                \item[Sequential] On the other hand, sequential process constructors build processes
                    which can \emph{maintain state}, i.e, the value on a certain output at a moment
                    in time can depend on the value of previous inputs and outputs of the circuit. A
                    simple example of a sequential process constructor is:

                    \begin{haskellcode}
        sourceSY :: (ProcType a, ProcType b) => ProcId
                 -> ProcFun (a -> a) -> a -> Signal a
                    \end{haskellcode}

            \end{description}

            The \texttt{mapSY} constructor can be seen as the equivalent of the usual \texttt{map}
            function, but in the context of \texttt{Signal}s: For each element of the input signal
            (at each clock cycle), it applies the function to it and then produces as its output the
            result of the function application.

            Instead of being passed a ``normal'' Haskell function (with type $a → b$),
            \texttt{mapSY} is passed a \texttt{ProcFun} (Process Function). ForSyDe has instances of
            \texttt{ProcFun} which allow for it to be processed with different
            \emph{interpretations}, such as simulation, generation of VHDL or generation of graph
            diagrams. Let's take a look at how one could use the \texttt{mapSY} constructor to model
            a simple incrementer process:

            \haskellfile{code/forsyde/forsyde-synchprocs-incrementer.hs}

            As already mentioned, ForSyDe makes heavy use of Template Haskell, and this example
            already clarifies how. First of all, the ``innermost'' expression (\verb;f x = x + 1;)
            is \emph{reified} by the ``\texttt{[d|}'' quasi-quoter into a list of declarations. This
            list of declarations is then transformed by \texttt{newProcFun} into an object of type
            \texttt{ExpQ} (Template Haskell's reified \emph{expression}). Finally, this reified
            expression is then \emph{spliced into place} and results in an object of type
            \texttt{ProcFun}.

            A \texttt{ProcFun} represents, intuitively, the syntax tree of the function, and by
            traversing this \texttt{ProcFun} ForSyDe can perform simulation and VHDL generation.
            There is, however, one big restriction on \texttt{ProcFun}s: As already seen in the type
            signature of \texttt{mapSY} above, the input and output types for the \texttt{ProcFun}
            have to be members of the \texttt{ProcType} class. Instances of \texttt{ProcType} are
            provided only for:

            \begin{description}
                \item[Primitive types] \texttt{Int}, \texttt{Int8}, \texttt{Int16},
                    \texttt{Int32}, \texttt{Bool}, \texttt{ForSyDe.Bit}.

                \item[Enumerated types] User-defined enumerations, with derived instances for
                    \texttt{Data} and \texttt{Lift}.

                \item[Containers] Tuples and fixed-length vectors (\texttt{Data.Param.FSVec}),
                    holding a type of the above two categories and unrestrictedly nested.
            \end{description}

            For VHDL to be generated from the system definition, ForSyDe imposes a series of extra
            restrictions on the form that all \texttt{ProcFun}s can take. Upon calling the
            \texttt{writeVHDL} function, the \texttt{ProcFun} objects are traversed, and a
            \emph{runtime} error occurs if any of them does not comply with the restrictions.  These
            restrictions are:

            \begin{description}
                \item[Pointed notation] Declarations with point-free notation are not
                    accepted as synthesizable

                \item[Single-clause] To be synthesizable, a \texttt{ProcFun} cannot have multiple
                    clauses, and it cannot have \texttt{let} or \texttt{where} blocks.  This
                    essentially forbids recursion inside \texttt{ProcFun}s. Pattern matching is
                    possible by using the \texttt{case} construct.
            \end{description}

            Further details on these restrictions and how they constrain circuit design are shown
            further ahead, when analyzing the studied circuits.

            Now that the concept of a \emph{process function} is clear, let's take a look at how to
            use a sequential process constructor. In this example, we are using the
            \texttt{sourceSY} constructor to build a counter that counts in ascending order starting
            from 0:

            \begin{haskellcode}
        counter :: Signal Int16
        counter = sourceSY "counterProc" incrFunc 0
            \end{haskellcode}

            Notice that we \emph{reuse} the \texttt{incrFunc} process function, as it does exactly
            what we need. The \texttt{sourceSY} constructor takes as parameters a process function
            $f$ and an initial value $x$, and has as output signal the sequence $ [x, f(x), f(f(x)),
            f(f(f(x))), \ldots] $. This behaviour is isomorphic to the behaviour of the function
            \texttt{iterate} from the Haskell Prelude.


        \subsubsection{Circuits modeled}
        \label{subsubsec:forsyde-circuits}
            Our comparative analysis of ForSyDe's strengths and weaknesses was done, as usual, by
            modeling the 3 circuits used as case-studies. ForSyDe has a peculiar ``dual'' nature,
            as it supports both shallow \emph{and} deep embedded models, and models written with
            netlist generation in mind can look \emph{very} different than models which do not
            comply with the restrictions that allow synthesis.

            Because of this dual nature of ForSyDe, when modeling the case-study circuits we
            considered 2 kinds of models:

            \begin{description}
                \item[High-level] A model that uses Haskell constructs inside the process functions
                    (\texttt{ProcFun}) as close as possible to what a functional programmer would
                    normally use. These models do not comply with ForSyDe's constraints on the
                    syntax tree of process functions for synthesis, and therefore \textbf{can
                        not be translated to VHDL}.

                \item[Synthesizable] These models are more fine-grained, and use
                    \textbf{exclusively} constructs that allow them to be synthesized by ForSyDe's
                    VHDL backend. They ``look'' much less like functional programs and more like
                    traditional pen-and-paper diagrams of circuits.
            \end{description}

            Let's start our analysis by looking at the \emph{high-level} model for circuit 1, the
            ALU, on listing~\ref{lst:forsyde-circuit1-model-alusim}:

            \begin{listing}[h!]
                \haskellfile{code/forsyde/forsyde-circuit1-model-alusim.hs}
                \caption{High-level ForSyDe model for the ALU.
                    \label{lst:forsyde-circuit1-model-alusim}}
            \end{listing}

            The first thing to notice is that the system is working over \emph{16-bit integers}, as
            by the definition of \texttt{WordType}. This is not exclusive of the high-level model,
            however, as ForSyDe can also produce VHDL models working with integers.

            We defined an enumeration type (\texttt{ALUOp}) that encodes possible ALU operations,
            and derived instances of the \texttt{Data} and \texttt{Lift} classes for it, as is
            required for \texttt{ALUOp} to be \texttt{ProcType}. In the body of the \texttt{aluFunc}
            process function, we perform pattern matching on the $f$ value to discover which
            operation to perform. Also, the body of \texttt{aluFunc} has a \texttt{where} block
            where all the ``parts'' that constitute the logic of the ALU are defined. Contrast this
            definition with the \emph{synthesizable} model of the ALU at listing
            \ref{lst:forsyde-circuit1-model-alusyn}:

            \begin{listing}[h!]
                \haskellfile{code/forsyde/forsyde-circuit1-model-alusyn.hs}
                \caption{Synthesizable ForSyDe model of the ALU.
                    \label{lst:forsyde-circuit1-model-alusyn}}
            \end{listing}

            This model suffers from two consequences of the restrictions imposed by ForSyDe to
            enable synthesis:

            \begin{itemize}
                \item It is too \textbf{fine grained}. As synthesizable \texttt{ProcFun}s cannot
                    have local definitions, \emph{every single} step in the datapath inside the
                    ALU has to be a process of its own.

                \item The parallel and serial combination of processes require several steps of
                    ``zipping'' and ``unzipping'' of signals, which have nothing to do with actual
                    computation.  They only adapt the interfaces of the processes to fit together,
                    and transform between \textbf{tuples of signals and signals of tuples}. We will
                    see the same problem when handling vectors of signals.
            \end{itemize}

            An extra weakness of ForSyDe that becomes more problematic in fine-grained models is the
            need for manual \emph{name management}. Each process in ForSyDe must have a
            user-provided unique identifier: on the one hand it results in readable and modular VHDL
            netlists, but on the other hand it forces the hardware designer to work at a lower level
            than desired, making the design more error-prone. In Lava, name management is avoided
            entirely, as the circuit models are flattened during netlist generation.

            The issue of name management in ForSyDe, along with the usage of fixed-length vectors,
            will become clearer as we analyze our second circuit: a RAM block of 64 lines.

            First of all, we model a n-bit register, which is not so different from the n-bit
            register we modeled in Lava:

            \haskellfile{code/forsyde/forsyde-circuit2-reg.hs}

            The next needed part for the RAM is a 64-to-1 multiplexer, to choose which of the RAM
            lines to select as output, depending on the address. We modeled a whole hierarchy of
            multiplexers up to the one we needed (64-to-1): starting with a 2-to-1 multiplexer, than
            building a 4-to-1 using 2-to-1 as components, 16-to-1 using 4-to-1 and finally 64-to-1
            using 16-to-1 and 4-to-1. We only show the first two degrees of the hierarchy in listing
            \ref{lst:forsyde-circuit2-muxes}.

            \begin{listing}[h!]
                \haskellfile{code/forsyde/forsyde-circuit2-muxes.hs}
                \caption{Excerpt from the hierarchy of multiplexers modeled in ForSyDe.
                    \label{lst:forsyde-circuit2-muxes}}
            \end{listing}

            The hierarchy of multiplexers is a perfect example to illustrate the aforementioned
            issue of zipping/unzipping: as an input to \texttt{mux4} we get a signal of binary
            vectors (each with length 2). But we want to use \texttt{mux2} as a component, therefore
            we need to \textbf{unzip} the signal of vectors into a vector of signals, and then
            \textbf{index} the vector to get each individual signal. In the case of \texttt{mux16}
            (not shown here), this situation becomes even worse as, besides unzipping, we need to
            \textbf{re-zip} the constituent signals into ``groups'' of the right size to be used
            with the subcomponents.

            As we already mentioned, the requirement of user-given unique names for processes in
            ForSyDe results in a much more readable VHDL output for the models. Another factor that
            helps in this direction is the ForSyDe concept of \emph{component instantiation}.

            When finished modeling a circuit in ForSyDe, we ``wrap it up'' in a \emph{system
                definition} (a value of type \texttt{SysDef}) by calling the function
            \texttt{newSysDef}. When we call \texttt{writeVHDL} on this system definition, a VHDL
            top-level \texttt{entity} is generated. If we then want to use this ``finished'' model
            as a subcomponent in another circuit, we can use the \emph{instantiate} function to
            create a named process out of the component's \texttt{SysDef}. When the VHDL code for
            the bigger circuit is generated, the ForSyDe instantiation is mapped to a VHDL
            \texttt{component} declaration (with accompanying \texttt{port map} statements), which
            makes for pretty modular VHDL code.

            Let's now finally look at the top-level ForSyDe model for circuit 2, the RAM block.  The
            code is presented at listing~\ref{lst:forsyde-circuit2-ram}.

            \begin{listing}[h!]
                \haskellfile{code/forsyde/forsyde-circuit2-ram.hs}
                \caption{Top-level ForSyDe model of circuit 2, the RAM block.
                    \label{lst:forsyde-circuit2-ram}}
            \end{listing}

            This model is also similar to the one wrote in Lava, and that is the reason for why we
            don't have separate \emph{high-level} and \emph{synthesizable} models for circuit 2. The
            ``natural'' model, i.e, the one that came to mind immediately reading the description of
            the circuit, happens to also be synthesizable. In this model, we use the parts already
            defined before (register, 64-to-1 multiplexer), as well as some simple gates
            (\texttt{and}, \texttt{or}) and an \emph{address decoder} (\texttt{decoder'}). We omit
            here the code for the address decoder, as it consists simply of an enumeration of all
            \emph{minterms} (all possible boolean products involving the 6 input bits and their
            negation).

            Lastly, let's analyze and discuss the ForSyDe model for circuit 3, the Hack CPU. We
            built the CPU using mostly already defined circuits (ALU, registers, multiplexers) as
            building blocks, which made the model also look very similar to the one written in Lava.
            This modular approach is not coincidental: in the book ``The Elements of Computing
            Systems''\cite{nand2tetris-book}, great care is taken to make each circuit in the
            hierarchy add only a small step in complexity when compared to its already defined
            subcomponents.

            In the case of the CPU, we needed to model three main additional components: a program
            counter, an instruction decoder, and a component that decides when to perform a jump.
            Let's first start by looking at the program counter:

            \haskellfile{code/forsyde/forsyde-circuit3-pc.hs}

            The address type \texttt{AddrType} is defined as \texttt{Int16} because the
            specification of circuit 3 requires so. The program counter is a simple counter with
            \texttt{reset} and \texttt{set} inputs. Presenting a \texttt{high} value at the
            \texttt{reset} input will cause the program counter to output 0 at the next clock cycle,
            which will make the CPU fetch the instruction from memory address 0, effectively
            rebooting the computer. Presenting a \texttt{high} value at the \texttt{set} input will
            cause the program counter to have as its next output the value currently present at
            input \texttt{addr}. This is the way in which \emph{jumps} are performed in the Hack
            architecture.

            Having defined the model for the program counter, we proceeded to test its behaviour,
            according to the table of test cases in \cite{nand2tetris-chapter-cpu}.

            \haskellfile{code/forsyde/forsyde-circuit3-pc-sim.hs}

            An important aspect of simulation with ForSyDe is that we can actually \emph{compare}
            the outputs of simulation for equality with an \emph{expected} sequence of inputs, which
            could \emph{not} be done in Lava.

            With the program counter defined and tested, we proceeded to model the instruction
            decoder, whose code is presented on listing~\ref{lst:forsyde-circuit3-decoder}.

            \begin{listing}[h!]
                \haskellfile{code/forsyde/forsyde-circuit3-decoder.hs}
                \caption{ForSyDe model for the Hack CPU instruction decoder.
                    \label{lst:forsyde-circuit3-decoder}}
            \end{listing}

            The job of the instruction decoder is very simple: it takes an instruction as input and
            outputs several signals to \emph{control} different parts of the CPU. It performs
            \emph{no computation} and merely \emph{rearranges} the wires. But even though it is such
            a simple circuit, the ForSyDe model is still ``ugly'' (full of indexing operators and
            tuple constructors). Because of ForSyDe's single-clause restriction on synthesizable
            \texttt{ProcFun}s, we cannot introduce a \texttt{where} block and give meaningful names
            to the several ``slices'' of the instruction that we are selecting.

            Now we go over the last needed subcomponent of the CPU we needed to model: a logical
            block which decides when to set the program counter and cause a jump to occur. The
            output of this circuit is connected to the \texttt{set} input of the program counter, as
            can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:cpu-parts}. The code for the ForSyDe version of the
            \texttt{decideJump} block is shown below:

            \haskellfile{code/forsyde/forsyde-circuit3-jump.hs}

            The decision on whether or not to perform a jump is taken based on two parameters: the
            first is a set of \texttt{jump selection bits} (named in the model as \texttt{JumpType},
            and comes from the instruction). These bits indicate in \emph{which conditions} a jump
            is to be performed. If they are all low, then no jump is performed, and if they are all
            high, an \emph{unconditional jump} will happen.  The second input for the
            \texttt{decideJump} circuit is the set of flags coming from the ALU. When some
            conditional jump is described in the \texttt{JumpType} bits, it will only actually
            happen if the correspondent ALU flags are active. The \texttt{decideJump} model was also
            tested for the input combinations described in the book\cite{nand2tetris-book}, but we
            omit the test code here for brevity.

            Having all the necessary parts we could then model the Hack CPU itself, whose code is
            presented on listing~\ref{lst:forsyde-circuit3-cpu}.

            \begin{listing}[h!]
                \haskellfile{code/forsyde/forsyde-circuit3-cpu.hs}
                \caption{Top-level ForSyDe model for circuit 3, the Hack CPU.
                    \label{lst:forsyde-circuit3-cpu}}
            \end{listing}

            This model also looks similar to the CPU model written in Lava, but the generated VHDL
            is very different, and that is a big advantage of ForSyDe. While Lava \emph{flattens}
            all the definitions and generates \textbf{one big} VHDL entity for the whole model,
            ForSyDe is able to use the \emph{component instantiations} to produce a
            \emph{hierarchical} VHDL design, where program counter, register, ALU, decoder, etc.,
            all have their \emph{own entity declarations in separate files}.

            As a closing remark on ForSyDe we can emphasize a general weakness of the library, which
            is not seen \emph{particularly} in any circuit model, but contributes to some of the
            problems discussed: ForSyDe is relatively old and not actively maintained. The last
            version available on Hackage\cite{website:forsyde-hackage} dates from 2010, and on the
            library's Hackage page there are still promises of a ``next version''.

            This is a problem specially because ForSyDe uses some technologies which are heavily
            dependent on GHC, and some aspects of the library could benefit from recent GHC
            developments. The \texttt{parameterized-data} package (containing the module
            \texttt{Data.Param.FSVec} of fixed-length vectors) could benefit from additions to the
            GHC type system (in particular the \texttt{TypeNats}\cite{website:ghc-typenats}
            extension) which facilitate the kind of dependent types emulated in that package.


    \subsection{Coquet}
    \label{subsec:coquet}
        The third analyzed EDSL for hardware description, Coquet\cite{coquet2011}, is strikingly
        different from both others. Most of these differences can be explained in one way or another
        by its choice of host ``language'' -- Coq\footnote{``Coq'' is not the name of a language,
            but a theorem-proving system that uses different languages for defining terms,
            interactive commands, and user-defined tactics}.

        Coq is an interactive theorem prover based on \emph{intuitionistic type theory}. In the
        context of Coq, the concepts of ``term'' and ``type'' are far more intertwined than, say, in
        Haskell. Types in Coq can contain references to terms and vice-versa. A very typical example
        of these so-called \emph{dependent types} is the type(-family) of vectors with a certain
        length:

        \begin{coqcode}
        Inductive vec A : nat -> Type :=
            | nil  : vec A 0
            | cons : forall (h : A) (n : nat),  vec A n -> vec A (S n).
        \end{coqcode}

        By having the length of the vector being part of the type, we can \emph{enforce} several
        useful properties of functions operating on vectors. In fact, the type-system of Coq is so
        expressive that it can encode any proposition of \emph{intuitionistic propositional logic}.

        Given such expressive power, one can imagine that it might be useful to express circuits in
        Coq, and use it to prove interesting properties about these circuits. This is exactly the
        goal of Coquet. How this goal is achieved and the modelling of our studied circuits in
        Coquet is discussed in the following subsections.

        \subsubsection{Modelling circuits}
        \label{subsubsec:coquet-modelling}
            Coquet is a deep-embedded DSL, thus it represents circuits as a datatype. By using
            dependent types, a designer modeling a circuit in Coquet is able to prevent certain
            kinds of mistakes much earlier in the design process, because the \emph{well-formedness}
            is guaranteed by construction, i.e, every circuit built using the constructors provided
            by Coquet are well-formed by definition. Let's take a look at the \emph{Circuit} data
            type declaration, presented in listing \ref{lst:coquet-circuit-type}.

            \begin{listing}[h!]
                \coqfile{code/coquet/coquet-definition-circuit.v}
                \caption{The Circuit datatype in Coquet
                    \label{lst:coquet-circuit-type}}
            \end{listing}

            The \texttt{Circuit} type is parameterized by two types. These types are the
            \emph{input} and \emph{output} types of the circuit, respectively. They \textbf{do not}
            represent what is ``carried'' on the wires, but the \emph{structure} of the circuit's
            input and output ports: How many of them there are, how are they grouped and how are
            they named.

            There are 2 \emph{atomic} constructors from which an element of \texttt{Circuit} can
            be built and 3 \emph{combinators}, which build a circuit based on other circuit(s).
            By observing the serial and parallel composition combinators (\texttt{Ser} and
            \texttt{Par}, respectively), we notice that the input and output types match exactly
            as expected.

            The 2 atomic constructors constrain the types \texttt{n} and \texttt{m} by requiring
            them to have instances of the ``Fin'' type class, i.e, they have to be \emph{finite}
            types (types from which a finite list of unique elements can be obtained). This
            constraint is important given the interpretation that these types (\texttt{n} and
            \texttt{m}) have: each element of \texttt{n} (respectively \texttt{m}) stands for an
            input (respectively output) ``wire'' in the circuit interface.

            The case of the ``Atom'' constructor is particularly revealing of how Coquet works: this
            constructor is parameterized by an \emph{instance} of the type class \texttt{Techno} for
            the types \texttt{n} and \texttt{m}. What this instance provides (in the code fragment
            that reads ``\texttt{techno n m}'') is the \emph{type of the fundamental gate} in the
            technology being used. We could choose our modeled circuits to have, for example, NAND,
            NOR, or other (more exotic) gates as fundamental.

            As an ``usage example'' of Coquet, we show two simple circuits (\texttt{NOT} and
            \texttt{HALFADD}), along with proofs that they implement the expected functions over
            booleans. Let's start with \texttt{NOT}:

            \coqfile{code/coquet/coquet-spec-not.v}

            The input type of \texttt{NOT} is a \emph{tagged unit} with tag \texttt{x}, similarly,
            the output type has tag \texttt{nx}. There is some \emph{notation} introduced by Coquet
            to make the creation of tagged units more convenient. The \texttt{NOT} circuit is a
            serial composition (denoted as \texttt{|>} of a \texttt{Fork2} circuit (which simply
            splits the input into two identical copies) and a \texttt{NOR} circuit, which is the
            underlying fundamental gate in this case.

            Below the definition of the circuit itself we state and prove the fact that our circuit
            implements the desired function (boolean negation, \texttt{negb}). More details on
            exactly what is meant by ``implements'', as well as the workings of plugs and tags, are
            exposed further ahead. A walk through of proofs in Coquet, where we explain the
            ``\texttt{tac}'' tactic, is given in section~\ref{subsubsec:coquet-circuits}. Now let's
            take a look at a half-adder described in Coquet:

            \coqfile{code/coquet/coquet-spec-halfadder.v}

            First of, the sum types that are given as parameters to \texttt{Circuit} indicate that
            we have two input ports and two output ports. By using \texttt{Fork2} on a binary sum
            (\texttt{[:a] + [:b]}), we create as output a sum type in which each of the components
            is in itself a sum: that matches exactly the interface of the component after the
            \texttt{|>} operator. On the right side of the serial composition, we have a parallel
            composition of \texttt{XOR} and \texttt{AND}, giving two outputs: respectively the sum
            (\texttt{[:s]}) and carry-out (\texttt{[:c]}) 

            Together with the definition, we prove that the \texttt{HADD} circuit implements the
            boolean function we would expect, and the proof is similar to the case of \texttt{NOT}.
            It makes use of a Coquet custom tactic (\texttt{tac}), but a more throughout example of
            proof of functional correctness will be given futher ahead.  Also, in the case of the
            adder used in our case study (ripple-carry adder), we prove that the circuit implements
            the \emph{actual} addition function on binary integers, and not some boolean equivalent.

            As a last detail on the ``user interface'' of Coquet, there is the definition of what
            exactly are the input and output types (a circuit of type \texttt{Circuit n m} has input
            type \texttt{n} and output type \texttt{m}). Usually, in the Coquet
            paper\cite{coquet2011} and in the examples provided with the library, input and output
            types are \emph{sum types} in which the terms of the sum are \emph{tagged units}. Using
            tags serves a form of ``documentation'', giving someone reading the circuit model an
            idea of what role does each input/output port play. The \emph{type family} of tagged
            unit types is defined as follows:

            \begin{coqcode}
        Inductive tag (t : string) : Type := _tag : tag t
        Notation "[: x ]" := (tag x).
        Notation "[! x ]" := (_tag x).
        Notation "[!!]"   := (_tag _).
            \end{coqcode}

            For each string \texttt{t}, there is a type \texttt{tag t}, and this type has exactly
            one inhabitant. There are also, as part of Coquet, some definitions to make working with
            sum types less tiresome. For example, there is the function \texttt{sumn} which, given a
            type \texttt{t} and a natural \texttt{n}, returns a sum type with \texttt{n} elements
            and in which each element has type \texttt{t}.  This might be useful if we are defining
            a n-bit adder:

            \begin{coqcode}
        Definition RIPPLE cin a b cout s n :
            Circuit  ([:cin] + sumn [:a] n + sumn [:b] n)  (sumn [:s] n + [:cout]) := ...
            \end{coqcode}

            While the provided examples use sums of tagged units as the input/output types, they can
            be more general: as seen in the definition of the circuit type (Fig.
            \ref{lst:coquet-circuit-type}), the only requirement is that they belong to the
            \texttt{Fin} type class, which is defined as follows:

            \begin{coqcode}
        Class Fin A := {
            eq_fin : eqT A;
            enum   : list A;
            axiom  : forall (x : A), count (equal x) enum = 1
        }.
            \end{coqcode}


        \subsubsection{Circuit semantics in Coquet}
        \label{subsubsec:coquet-semantics}
            In Coquet, the \emph{structure} and \emph{semantics} of a circuit are strictly
            separated. The structure of a circuit is modeled by a value of type \texttt{Circuit},
            and it describes solely which are the parts that the circuit is made of and how they are
            interconnected\footnote{The \texttt{Circuit} datatype is also parameterized by the type
                of fundamental gate used in the design.}.

            On the other hand, circuit \emph{semantics} (what operation does the circuit
            \emph{perform}) is described in Coquet by a \emph{meaning relation}. The meaning
            relation for a circuit relates its inputs to outputs, and is defined by induction on
            circuit structure.

            For a circuit type \texttt{Circuit n m} and considering \texttt{𝕋} as the type of
            what is carried in the wires, we can define the type \emph{ins} (stands for
            ``inputs'') as $n \rightarrow 𝕋$ and \emph{outs} as $m \rightarrow 𝕋$. These are
            functions that, for each input/output port, provide the a value present at that port
            -- they are in this way \emph{isomorphic} to cartesian products, and this isomorphism
            is indeed used to facilitate proofs of correctness in Coquet, as will be seen later.
            The definition of the meaning relation in Coquet is presented on
            listing~\ref{lst:coquet-definition-semantics}.

            \begin{listing}[h!]
                \coqfile{code/coquet/coquet-definition-semantics.v}
                \caption{Coquet definition of circuit semantics.
                    \label{lst:coquet-definition-semantics}}
            \end{listing}

            We can notice that the definition of \texttt{Semantics} has constructors that correspond
            to the constructors of \texttt{Circuit}. So, for example, given the semantics of two
            circuits \texttt{x} and \texttt{y}, we can obtain the semantics of their \emph{serial
                composition} (\texttt{Ser x y}) by using the \texttt{KSer} constructor. This
            inductive definition of semantics can also be used in proofs. If we need to prove a
            statement of the form: \coq;Semantics (Ser x y) ins outs;

            Then we can \texttt{apply} the \texttt{KSer} constructor to split the goal into the
            following subgoals:

            \begin{coqcode}
        Semantics x ins middles
        Semantics y middles outs
            \end{coqcode}

            While the meaning relation defines exactly the behaviour of a circuit, it is too
            low-level. We want to be able to express our \emph{specification} for circuit behaviour
            in a \emph{higher level} of abstraction -- after all, the whole point of proving
            correctness is making sure that the circuit we are modeling is \emph{equivalent} (in a
            sense) to a specification that we \emph{assume as correct}.

            Coquet offers some tools to help the user in this direction. First of all, it offers the
            designer two kinds of abstraction to facilitate writing high-level specifications:

            \begin{description}
                \item[Data abstraction] The meaning relation (\texttt{Semantics}) for a circuit is a
                    relation between two \emph{functions} (\emph{ins} and \emph{outs}), which is
                    cumbersome to reason about. Therefore, Coquet allows the user to express the
                    specification for a circuit in terms of higher-level types, provided that
                    isomorphisms between these higher-level types and the function types are
                    provided. Several isomorphisms for common cases of input/output types are
                    already provided in the Coquet library, such as the isomorphism between ($
                    \text{sumn} \: \text{\textbf{1}} \: n \rightarrow 𝔹$) and ($ 𝔹^{n} $), where
                \textbf{1} stands for the unit type and \texttt{𝔹} for boolean).

                \item[Behavioural abstraction] A circuit can be said to satisfy a weak specification
                    \texttt{R} if we can prove the logical entailment of \texttt{R} by the meaning
                    relation. The specification \texttt{R} already benefits from \emph{data
                        abstraction}, and ranges over the high-level types.
            \end{description}

            There are two ways to express compliance with a specification: we can say either that a
            circuit \texttt{\textbf{Realises}} a certain relation (up to isomorphisms) or that it
            \texttt{\textbf{Implements}} a certain function (up to isomorphisms). The difference
            between the \emph{relational} and the \emph{functional} models is that the functional
            model can only account for \emph{deterministic} specifications (an input combination
            maps to only one output), while with the relational model we can also write
            non-deterministic specifications. The definitions for the Coquet classes
            \texttt{Realise} and \texttt{Implement} are shown in
            listing~\ref{lst:coquet-definition-realise-implement}.

            \begin{listing}[h!]
                \coqfile{code/coquet/coquet-definition-realise-implement.v}
                \caption{Definition of the \texttt{Realise} and \texttt{Implement} type classes.
                    \label{lst:coquet-definition-realise-implement}}
            \end{listing}

            Is we want to prove that a certain circuit \texttt{c} \emph{implements} a certain
            function \emph{f} (the high-level specification), then our goal in Coq will be:
            \coq;Implement c f; To prove this kind of statement, one can ``break down'' the meaning
            relation hypothesis, resulting in one \texttt{Semantics} hypothesis per circuit
            subcomponent.  Then the already-proven specifications of the subcomponents could be used
            to rewrite the \texttt{Semantics} hypotheses into equations. This makes for very modular
            proofs, and this will become clearer with the example proofs in section
            \ref{subsubsec:coquet-circuits}.


        \subsubsection{Example circuits and proofs}
        \label{subsubsec:coquet-circuits}
            Until now we explained several aspects of the ``inner workings'' of Coquet: How
            circuits are modeled, how the \texttt{Circuit} dependent type guarantees well-formed
            models \emph{by construction}, what Coquet considers as the \emph{semantics} of a
            circuit, and what does it mean to say in Coquet that a circuit satisfies a
            specification. What was not covered, however, is how to actually write proofs of
            correctness in Coquet.

            In this section we will walk over some examples of circuit models in Coquet, in
            increasing order of complexity, and also comment on their proofs of correctness. This
            review should give the reader an idea of the general structure of circuits and proofs in
            Coquet. It should also serve as base for our comparative analysis of Coquet with the
            other EDSLs.

            Let's start by analyzing a hierarchy of adders. The most basic of these adders is a half
            adder:

            \coqfile{code/coquet/coquet-model-halfadder.v}

            This is pretty straightforward circuit model: we just combine \texttt{XOR} and
            \texttt{AND} in parallel, and each of them provides one of the outputs of the circuit
            (sum and carry-out). The \texttt{Fork2} \emph{plug} just ``copies'' its input into two
            identical outputs. While there is very little to comment on the circuit model, the proof
            of correctness will give us a bit more insight into Coquet:

            \coqfile{code/coquet/coquet-proof-halfadder.v}

            The proof is considerably short, but all the ``work'' is being done behind the scenes by
            the custom tactic \texttt{tac}, introduced by Coquet. This tactic is geared towards
            proving simple circuits concisely, and its definition reads as follows:

            \coqfile{code/coquet/coquet-tac.v}

            The definition of \texttt{tac} is itself just a (sequential) combination of other custom
            tactics also defined by Coquet. We don't need to go deeper, however, as we can explain
            the general mechanism of each line in \texttt{tac}.

            First of all, \texttt{rinvert} performs \emph{inversion} using the constructors of
            \texttt{Semantics}, and will transform the meaning relation hypothesis into a series of
            hypotheses, one for each component of the circuit. Then \texttt{realise\_all} is called,
            which uses the \emph{correctness proofs of the components} (stored in a hint database)
            in order to rewrite \emph{each \texttt{Semantics} hypothesis into an equality involving
                high-level types}. Finally, the tactic \texttt{unreify\_all} uses the isomorphisms
            to transform the equality in the goal into one involving only booleans. From them on we
            just \texttt{destruct} all booleans, which results in a proof by case analysis.

            Going one step up in the hierarchy of adders, we have the Coquet model of a full adder:

            \coqfile{code/coquet/coquet-model-fulladder.v}

            In the definition of a full adder, we use a half adder as component, along with an
            \texttt{OR} gate. The interesting point of this definition, though, is the usage of the
            \texttt{Rewire} components. Earlier, when presenting the \texttt{Circuit} datatype in
            Coquet, we mentioned that one of the circuit constructors (\texttt{Plug}) is meant to be
            used to ``adapt'' the interface of two circuits which we need to combine.

            In example of \texttt{FADD}, all the necessary plugs involved only regropuing of ports
            (they are all \emph{associativity plugs}) and, in these cases, the plug functions are
            fully defined by their type, which allows us to avoid writing the functions ourselves
            and let Coq find the terms using \emph{proof search}. That's why we use Coq's
            \texttt{Program} command to define the circuit: in the definition, there are some
            \emph{holes} where the plug functions should be (we omit the full \texttt{Rewire} lines
            for brevity), and we need to ``fill'' each of these holes after defining \texttt{FADD}
            -- that is being done in each of the \texttt{Next Obligation} blocks.

            The correctness proof for \texttt{FADD} uses the exact same tactics as the one for
            \texttt{HADD}, we only include it here for completeness:

            \coqfile{code/coquet/coquet-proof-fulladder.v}

            This proof can be used as an example to understand how Coquet provides for highly
            \emph{modular verification}. The proof \texttt{FADD\_Implement} also uses the
            \texttt{tac} tactic that we already explained. When the \texttt{realise\_all} step of
            \texttt{tac} is performed, we already have \emph{the correctness proof of \texttt{HADD}
                in the hint database}, and therefore the hypothesis involving the \texttt{Semantics}
            of \texttt{HADD} is readily rewritten as an equality involving its high-level
            specification.

            In the last step of the adder hierarchy we are presenting, there is a classic
            ripple-carry binary adder. With this example, we demonstrate how a \emph{parametric
                circuit} can be defined using recursion in Coquet:

            \coqfile{code/coquet/coquet-model-ripple.v}

            The definition is recursive on the size $n$ of inputs and outputs. The full adder
            previously defined (\texttt{FADD}) is used to calculate the least significant bit of the
            output, and we use \texttt{RIPPLE} recursively to calculate the remaining bits. The
            component \texttt{high\_lows} is used to ``split'' the inputs and then they are combined
            into the desired output shape by \texttt{combine'}. Notable in the structure of
            \texttt{RIPPLE} is the heavy usage of \texttt{RewireE} plugs to adapt the several parts
            of the circuit connected serially. Similarly to when defining \texttt{FADD}, we also
            used proof search to ``fill the gaps'' left by the associativity plugs.

            The proof of correctness for \texttt{RIPPLE} is not as straightforward anymore as the
            ones we have seen until now. In fact, we are only going to show some excerpts of the
            proof. This difference in proof complexity is due to 2 main reasons:

            \begin{itemize}
                \item It is a true \emph{proof by induction}, whereas in the previous proofs only
                    \emph{case analysis} was performed.
                \item We prove the compliance of \texttt{RIPPLE} to a \emph{high-level
                        specification}: instead of proving that the circuit implements some boolean
                    function (as previously), we prove that \texttt{RIPPLE} implements integer
                    addition on n-bit integers.
            \end{itemize}

            The function used as specification for \texttt{RIPPLE} can be seen in the following
            excerpt:

            \coqfile{code/coquet/coquet-proof-ripple-sig.v}

            Besides the higher level of the specification, we can also notice that here we are
            explicitly providing the isomorphisms between high (specification) and low
            (implementation) types. To get an idea of how the proof for \texttt{RIPPLE} would
            process, we show here the base case ($n = 0$):

            \coqfile{code/coquet/coquet-proof-ripple-base.v} 

            There are some similarities with the previous proofs -- we also use
            \texttt{realise\_all} and \texttt{unreify\_all} -- but tactics related to integer
            arithmetics are now also needed, because of the way in which the specification is
            expressed.

            Now, to finish our walk-through of Coquet's circuit models and proofs, we will look at a
            \emph{sequential} circuit: A 1-bit register. The specification of behaviour for
            sequential circuits in Coquet is significantly more involved and, in fact, the original
            Coquet paper\cite{coquet2011} leaves a ``more thorough investigation of state-holding
            devices'' for future work. But before delving into the specification, let's first look
            at the circuit model itself:

            \coqfile{code/coquet/coquet-model-register.v}

            The basic building block for the register is the \texttt{DFF} flip-flop. Also, we
            duplicate (\texttt{Fork2}) the output of the flip-flop and use the \texttt{Loop}
            constructor to direct one of these wires back into the \texttt{MUX}. The specification
            for the behaviour of a register is based on \emph{streams}: in the meaning relation, the
            type \texttt{𝕋} of what is carried in the wires is not simply 𝔹, but $ ℕ \rightarrow 𝔹 $
            (where 𝔹 stands for boolean). Also, we don't use the \emph{functional}
            (\texttt{Implement}) model anymore, but the relational one.

            \coqfile{code/coquet/coquet-proof-register-sig.v}

            The specification dictates that the output stream must have a one-element \emph{prefix}
            (\texttt{pre}) equal to \texttt{false} and, from then on, be either equal to the previous
            value at port \texttt{a} (whenever \texttt{load} is high) or to the previous value at
            port \texttt{out} (whenever \texttt{load} is low). From this example it is already clear
            that sequential specification does not fit nicely into the
            \texttt{Realise}/\texttt{Implement} model, and a more comfortable way to specify and
            prove the behaviour of sequential circuits would be a welcome addition to Coquet.


        \subsubsection{Closing remarks and possible improvements}
        \label{subsubsec:coquet-improv}
            Coquet employs very well several features of dependently-typed programming in general,
            and of the Coq system in particular, in order to facilitate circuit modeling and
            verification. The following advantages of Coquet make it particularly distinct from
            the other studied EDSLs:

            \begin{itemize}
                \item The use if \textbf{dependent types} makes certain classes of design mistakes
                    (such as short-circuits or ``floating'' wires) \emph{impossible by design}.

                \item By using \textbf{type classes} as a way to structure its definitions, Coquet
                    facilitates the automatization of proofs. For example, when trying to prove the
                    correctness of a circuit, we can use the correctness proofs of all its
                    subcomponents, and they are automatically located by Coq's \emph{instance
                        resolution} mechanism.

                \item Coquet avoids the problem of \textbf{observable sharing} by not using bound
                    variables, and building circuits only with combinators. The usage of combinators
                    is facilitated by some particular Coq features, like \emph{notations} and
                    \emph{proof search}.

                \item Coquet is able to prove properties over \textbf{parametric circuits} for
                    \emph{all values of the parameters} (by induction), while Lava, for example, can
                    only verify those properties for specific instances.

                \item The \textbf{parametrization} of the \texttt{Circuit} type by the \emph{type of
                        the fundamental gate} and the parametrization of the \texttt{Semantics}
                    relation by the \emph{semantics of the fundamental gate} make Coquet's approach
                    extremely generic. All of Coquet's defined tactics, classes and instances could
                    be used in radically different contexts such as three-valued logics, analog
                    domains or probabilistic domains.
            \end{itemize}

            Although Coquet is superior to the other studied EDSLs in the aforementioned aspects,
            some other aspects of circuit modeling and verification with Coquet could benefit from
            concepts present in ForSyDe or Lava

            First of all, \emph{simulation} of combinational circuits in Coquet is easy, but
            currently it is \emph{impossible} to simulate any form of sequential circuit. More
            precisely, any circuit containing the \texttt{Loop} constructor cannot be simulated --
            this restriction also bans the simulation of combinational loops, but simulating
            combinational loops does not make much sense anyways.

            Coquet's definition of the \emph{meaning relation} for circuits depends on the \emph{type
                \texttt{T} of what is carried in the wires}. The Coquet library already provides
            instances for booleans and streams of booleans ($ℕ \rightarrow 𝕋$), but it could also be
            interesting to add cases for dealing with some three-valued logics, or a case for
            IEEE1164's std\_logic type, used often in VHDL.

            Another interesting point is that Coquet defines a \texttt{stream} type family, and then
            proceeds to define several interesting functions over \texttt{stream}, as well as an
            instance for the meaning relation. The type family is defined as follows:

            \begin{coqcode}
        Definition stream A := nat -> A.
            \end{coqcode}

            If instead of using \texttt{nat} in the above definition, we generalized it a bit more
            (abstracting a new type parameter), we arrive at the concept of an ``event stream'':

            \begin{coqcode}
        Definition events tag A : tag -> A.
            \end{coqcode}

            This is exactly how ForSyDe defines its ``signals'', so we could model circuits in
            models of computation other than the synchronous model (which is the one allowed by the
            current \texttt{stream} definition).
